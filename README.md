# LoRaWAN ns-3 module #

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/ns-3-lorawan)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/signetlabdei/lorawan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/signetlabdei/lorawan)

This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") module that can be used
to perform simulations of a [LoRaWAN](http://www.lora-alliance.org/technology
"LoRa Alliance") network. The orginal module which is intended for Class A has now been extended
for LoRaWAN Class B.

Please read the `README-EXTENSION.md` for the extension that is added on the orginal module to include 
LoRaWAN Class B multicast which can also be used for LoRaWAN Class B unicast by using multicast groups with one member.
The Class B module also impliments the "Ping-slot relaying" algorithm proposed in [4] and [5] to improve multicast performance. 

## Getting started ##

### Prerequisites ###

Please see `README-EXTENSION.md` for running this this module with ns-3.29. 

To run simulations using this module, you will need to install ns-3, and clone
this repository inside the `src` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev-git ns-3
git clone https://github.com/signetlabdei/lorawan ns-3/src/lorawan
```

If you are interested in having the latest features (and more bug-prone code),
you can check out the develop branch:

```bash
cd ns-3/src/lorawan
git checkout develop
```

### Compilation ###

If you are interested in only compiling the `lorawan` module and its
dependencies, copy the `.ns3rc` file from `ns-3/utils` to `ns-3`, where `ns-3`
is your ns-3 installation folder, and only enable the desired module by making
sure the file contains the following line:

```python
modules_enabled = ['lorawan']
```

To compile, move to the `ns-3-dev` folder, configure and then build ns-3:

```bash
./waf configure --enable-tests --enable-examples
./waf build
```

Finally, make sure tests run smoothly with:

```bash
./test.py -s lorawan
```

If the script returns that the lorawan test suite passed, you are good to go.
Otherwise, if tests fail or crash, consider filing an issue.

## Usage examples ##

The module includes the following examples:

- `simple-lorawan-network-example`
- `complete-lorawan-network-example`
- `network-server-example`
- See the `README-EXTENSION.md` for Class B example.

Examples can be run via the `./waf --run example-name` command.

## Acknowledgments and relevant publications ##

The initial version of this code was developed as part of a master's thesis at
the [University of Padova](https://unipd.it "Unipd homepage"), under the
supervision of Prof. Lorenzo Vangelista, Prof. Michele Zorzi and with the help
of Marco Centenaro.

The LoRaWAN Class B multicast part was later added as part of an master's thesis
at the [Technical University of Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl "TU Delft homepage"), 
under the supervision of [Dr. Ir. Fernando Kuipers](https://fernandokuipers.nl/).
